This directory contains the trajectories of the animals performing the AAPA test.  

Trajectories of the control group of animals start with "ho*"; treated animals (with silver-nanoparticles) use the "nd*" format. The number afther that specifies the trial number, followed by the animal id (in the "rXX" format). 
That is:

nd2r10_Arena_20150512_125046

is the trajectory for the 2nd trial of the treated animal #10 in the Arena coordinates (nd2r10_Room_20150512_125046 is the one in the Room reference frame). 

Details of the file format are given in the file header itself.
